<div id="page_tos">
<ol>
	<li class="toplevel">Your relationship with Beer Crush

    	<ol>
    		<li>Your use of Beer Crush's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Beer Crush under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Beer Crush. "Beer Crush" means Beer Crush Inc., whose principal place of business is at P.O. Box 2941, Vashon, Washington, 98070, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</li>
			<li>Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Beer Crush, your agreement with Beer Crush will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the "Universal Terms".</li>
			<li>Your agreement with Beer Crush will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the "Additional Terms". Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</li>
			<li>The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Beer Crush in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the "Terms".</li>
			<li>If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="toplevel">Accepting the Terms
		<ol>
			<li>In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</li>
			<li>You can accept the Terms by:
				<ol>
					<li>clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Beer Crush in the user interface for any Service; or</li>
					<li>by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Beer Crush will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Beer Crush, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.</li>
			<li>Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li class="toplevel">Language of the Terms

    		<li>If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</li>

    		<li>You acknowledge and agree that while Beer Crush may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Beer Crush at any time, at Beer Crush's discretion.</li>
